## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is APCM different from my regular visits?
**A:** Yes! APCM provides *ongoing* care coordination throughout the month—not just during appointments. You'll receive proactive support, regular medication reviews, and coordination with your other healthcare providers.

### Q: Will I still have regular office visits?
**A:** Absolutely. APCM is *in addition to* your regular visits, not a replacement. You'll continue to see your provider as needed.

### Q: Can I use APCM with Medicare Advantage?
**A:** APCM is primarily for Original Medicare (Part B). If you have Medicare Advantage, please ask us about your options.

### Q: What if I already see another doctor for APCM?
**A:** Medicare only allows one provider to bill APCM for you at a time. If you're receiving APCM elsewhere, you would need to stop that service before enrolling with us.

- **Phone**: 205-709-1820
