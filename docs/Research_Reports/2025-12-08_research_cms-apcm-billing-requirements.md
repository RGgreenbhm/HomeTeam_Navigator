**Date**: December 8, 2025  
**Status**: Research Complete  
**Priority**: HIGH - Required for APCM billing continuation  
**Researcher**: Claude AI Assistant

## Executive Summary

Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) is a new Medicare program effective January 1, 2025, that provides monthly reimbursement for primary care management services. When patients transfer from one provider (Southview) to another (Home Team Medical Services), **new consent must be obtained** by the new billing provider.

**Key Findings**:
1. APCM consent is required once per provider relationship
2. Consent can be verbal or written, but must be documented
3. Only one provider can bill APCM per patient per month
4. New consent required when billing provider changes
5. No complex "transfer" process - new provider simply obtains new consent

---

## APCM Program Overview

### What is APCM?

Advanced Primary Care Management combines elements of several existing care management services into a simplified monthly billing structure:

- Chronic Care Management (CCM)
- Principal Care Management (PCM)
- Transitional Care Management (TCM)
- Communication technology-based services

### APCM Billing Codes

| Code | Patient Complexity | 2025 Payment |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| **G0556** | 0-1 chronic conditions | ~$15/month |
| **G0557** | 2+ chronic conditions | ~$50/month |
| **G0558** | 2+ chronic conditions + QMB status | ~$110/month |

**Note**: G0558 patients (Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries) have no out-of-pocket cost.

---

## Consent Requirements

### CMS Official Requirements

Per CMS guidelines, the consent process must inform the patient that:

1. **Service Availability**: APCM services are available from the provider
2. **Single Provider Rule**: Only one practitioner can furnish and be paid for APCM services during a calendar month
3. **Right to Stop**: Patient may discontinue APCM services at any time (effective at end of calendar month)
4. **Cost Sharing**: Patient may have cost-sharing obligations (copay, coinsurance, deductible)

### Consent Format

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Form** | Written OR verbal |
| **Documentation** | Must be documented in medical record |
| **Frequency** | Required once per provider relationship |
| **Who Can Obtain** | Billing provider or auxiliary personnel under general supervision |

### Sample Consent Language

Based on CMS requirements:

```
APCM Consent Statement

I, [Patient Name], understand and agree to the following:

1. I consent to receive Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) services 
   from Dr. Robert Green, MD and Home Team Medical Services.

2. I understand that only one provider can bill Medicare for APCM services 
   on my behalf during any calendar month.

3. I understand that I may have cost-sharing obligations (copay, coinsurance, 
   or deductible) for these services, unless I am a Qualified Medicare 
   Beneficiary (QMB).

4. I understand that I may discontinue APCM services at any time by 
   notifying my provider. Discontinuation will be effective at the end 
   of the current calendar month.

5. I understand that my provider will serve as my primary care coordinator 
   and the focal point for all my healthcare services.

Patient Signature: ___________________ Date: ___________
(or Verbal Consent documented by: ___________ on ___/___/____)
```

## Provider Transfer Process

### When a Patient Changes APCM Providers

When a patient transfers from one practice to another (e.g., Southview → Home Team):

1. **Previous provider stops billing**: Southview would bill APCM for their last month of providing services
2. **New provider obtains consent**: Home Team obtains new APCM consent
3. **New provider begins billing**: Home Team begins billing in the month after consent

### No "Transfer" Mechanism

**Important**: There is no formal "transfer" of APCM enrollment between providers. 

- The new provider simply obtains their own consent
- CMS tracks attribution by which provider bills each month
- If two providers attempt to bill for the same patient in the same month, the claim would be rejected for the second submitter

### Timeline for Your Transition

| Date | Action | Billing Impact |
|------|--------|----------------|
| December 2025 | Southview bills APCM for their patients | Southview receives December payment |
| December 2025 | Dr. Green obtains new consent from patients | No billing yet |
| January 1, 2026 | Home Team can begin billing APCM | Home Team submits January claim |

## What Your Consent Form Should Include

### Required Elements

Per CMS, your consent form must document:

1. ☐ Patient was informed APCM services are available
2. ☐ Patient was informed only one provider can bill per month
3. ☐ Patient was informed of right to stop services
4. ☐ Patient was informed cost-sharing may apply
5. ☐ Consent was documented in medical record
6. ☐ Date consent was obtained
7. ☐ Name of person who obtained consent (if auxiliary personnel)

### Recommended Additional Elements

For your specific transition scenario:

1. ☐ Records retention consent (separate requirement for your transition)
2. ☐ Acknowledgment that APCM billing is transferring from Southview to Home Team
3. ☐ Patient understands their APCM care continues with Dr. Green
4. ☐ Electronic signature acknowledgment (if using e-forms)

### Your Current Consent Form Review

Based on your existing `consent-form-draft.md`, your form includes:

✅ Records retention consent  
✅ APCM continuation election  
✅ Billing transfer authorization (Southview → Home Team TIN)  
✅ Electronic signature acknowledgment  

**Recommendation**: Add explicit APCM consent elements per CMS requirements:
- Single-provider disclosure
- Cost-sharing disclosure
- Right-to-discontinue disclosure

---

## Billing Transfer Authorization

### The TIN Issue

APCM billing is tied to the provider's Tax Identification Number (TIN):

| Entity | TIN | Role |
|--------|-----|------|
| Southview Medical Group | Southview TIN | Currently billing APCM |
| Home Team Medical Services | Home Team TIN | Will bill APCM starting January 2026 |

### What Patients Need to Authorize

Patients should understand:

1. Southview will **stop** billing Medicare APCM on their behalf after December 31, 2025
2. Home Team will **start** billing Medicare APCM on their behalf starting January 1, 2026
3. This is a change in billing entity, not a new service enrollment

### Sample Billing Transfer Language

```
APCM Billing Transfer Authorization

I understand that:

1. My APCM services have been provided by Dr. Robert Green at Southview 
   Medical Group (TIN: [Southview TIN]).

2. Effective January 1, 2026, my APCM services will be provided by 
   Dr. Robert Green at Home Team Medical Services (TIN: [Home Team TIN]).

3. Southview Medical Group will no longer bill Medicare for APCM services 
   on my behalf after December 31, 2025.

4. My APCM benefits and services will continue without interruption - 
   only the billing entity is changing.

5. I authorize Home Team Medical Services to bill Medicare for APCM 
   services on my behalf starting January 1, 2026.
```

## Documentation Requirements

### What Must Be in the Medical Record

CMS requires documentation of:

1. **Consent obtained**: Date and method (written/verbal)
2. **Who obtained consent**: Provider name or auxiliary personnel name
3. **Patient acknowledgment** of all required disclosures
4. **Care plan**: Patient-centered comprehensive care plan
5. **Service delivery**: Evidence of APCM service elements provided

### Audit Trail

## FAQ for Your Transition

### Q: Do patients need to re-enroll in APCM?

**A**: Not technically "re-enroll," but they need to provide consent to the **new billing provider** (Home Team). This is a new consent, not a transfer of the old one.

### Q: Can Southview and Home Team both bill APCM in the same month?

**A**: No. Only one provider can bill APCM per patient per month. Ensure clean handoff at month boundary.

### Q: What if a patient refuses to consent to Home Team?

**A**: They simply won't receive APCM services from Home Team. They could:
- Receive APCM from another provider
- Receive regular primary care without APCM
- Their choice doesn't affect records transfer consent

### Q: Is verbal consent really sufficient?

**A**: Yes, per CMS. However, for your transition:
- Written consent provides better documentation
- Microsoft Forms captures timestamp and content
- Reduces disputes if ever questioned

### Q: What happens to patients who don't respond to consent outreach?

**A**: 
- You cannot bill APCM for them until consent is obtained
- You can still provide regular primary care services
- Follow up attempts should be documented
- Some patients may need in-person consent at next visit

### Q: Do QMB patients still need consent?

**A**: Yes. QMB status affects cost-sharing (they have none), not consent requirements.
