=== Advanced Primary Care Management (APCM) Program Orientation ===

Thank you for choosing Home Team Medical Services as your medical home for APCM.  Advanced Primary Care takes traditional primary care to the next level by adding more proactive monitoring services and an integrated care team support. Our goal is to know and care for you on a personal level.  This journey begins by building a relationship with your dedicated primary care provider (PCP) so we can understand you on a human level and adjust our capabilities to better meet your goals. The rest of our team supports your PCP in this mission. 

We view our relationship with you and the important people in your life as a partnership. You can help us find the best medical and treatment recommendations by verifying the accuracy of your information as it appears in your care plan below. While we update your care plan throughout the year, your Annual Wellness Visit is the time when we intend for you to meet with your PCP and Care Management Team Leader every year to address anything on your care plan that needs clarification.  Please invite any key family members or caregivers you want to be involved in this discussion to your Annual Visit.

=== CLINICAL GOALS ===

1. PLAN FOR WELLNESS: list routine health maintenance recommendations and track whether you have had them, declined them, or specified a plan for how and when to address them.  These include items like vaccinations, cancer screening tests, and other routine preventative health assessments (like the questionnaires we review together during your annual visits). 

2. MANAGE CHRONIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS: your known medical problems are listed in the problem list section of your chart and the care plan below. Relevant information for each condition is organized in ways that help us communicate to you what we know about you and for us to coordinate together on plans to manage your health needs. 

3. SPECIFY PERSONALIZED STANDING ORDERS: these are orders your PCP and Care Team Physician Leader list so that your care management staff may do more to advocate for you between visits.  

4. SPECIFY KEY CAREGIVERS: maintain a list of family members, and other people you want involved in your care.  This includes information about anyone you have named as a medical power of attorney or surrogate decision maker who can speak on your behalf if you are ever unable to speak for yourself. 

5. SPECIFY PERSONALIZED GOALS OF CARE: this includes advanced directives like your preferences for code status (Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment), and any specific functional goals you may have (for things you want to do, but have trouble doing on your own).  


=== GENERAL PATIENT TASKS ===

=== GENERAL CARE TEAM TASKS ===
