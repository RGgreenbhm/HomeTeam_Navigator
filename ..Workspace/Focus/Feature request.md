A few housekeeping items:  1.  Please change the folder name "GitStatus" that is nested under ..workspace and history folder to the name "SyncLogs".  2.  Save a claude-command to that tells how to generate this desktop shortcut for the claude code CLI.  3.  Please update the Claude command for workspace-sync to ensure it provides adequate instructions to synchronize the current workspace with github repo, and, for all files that don't go to GitHub including those that require secure PHI storage, sync those to an Azure storage location.  If there are device specific and environment specific files, save them to the secure storage location as well, but mark them as device specific so that when we run this same claude command for "workspace-sync" on another VS code workspace it will know how to handle them.  Prior to synchronizing, show the user a brief summary of which storage locations are about to be used like the azure location name and tenant name (not GUID), and github repo name and branch that about to be used, then remind the user to verify an internet explorer browser is opened and logged into the right microsoft account so that the authentication pop-up for approving link to azure will go smoothly.  When the user approves, first generate and save a file under the "SyncLogs" folder (file name should begin with timestamp and then the user's first and last name), that would contain enough details to serve as an audit log that we could use for demonstrating HIPAA compliance.   We will plan another workflow in the future that tracks these SynchLog files and can generate reports that we can review for routine internal auditing purposes.  During the sync with azure storage, check if folder "RG-VScode-workspace-syncs" already exists off the root, and if note present, create it.  We'll use this location to clarify where we keep my workspace backups (separate from the live app data). Anticipate that if we have other users like Pat Rutledge or Pavel Savine that need to make workplace syncs, we'll use the same naming convention with their initials "PR" or "PS" as opposed to the "RG" for me as Robert Green.  That way when you display to user which target folder on the Azure storage location will be used for the sync you are preparing, the user will see the folder name and have opportunity to approve vs. request a different folder.  Storing the active workspace user as an environmental variable may help to catch this as well, since we wont know which azure credentials they will use for login until after the sync has started.    Prefer to merge files and keep the newest one when there are conflicts.  By virtue of the fact we are creating a SyncLog file before sending the sync, we should be able to trace if there are version issues within the folder history without having to store redundant full folder backups.  These are just snapshots of where we are with the live data, not the primary source, as I will also maintain latest backup per device on a dev drive (usually on D:\) with the most recent backup from that device that could be used for retrieval if the azure location gets lost.
