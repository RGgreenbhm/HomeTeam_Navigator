# RG prompt 1:  

Advise me on how to make the most of claude code.  I am still relatively new to coding and development, and trying to get my computer setup optimized for creating new programs to support my medical business, in which I am acting as president, chief medical officer, and user interface developer.  I have a CEO, Pat Rutledge, who is well versed in VS code and using claude code, and a CTO, Pavel Savine, who is better versed on backend development.  My main focus right now is how to establish a patient explorer app that will let me capture information about patients I have in a practice using Allscripts as EMR before I finish leaving the practice.  I am leaving the first practice (Southview) to merge with another practice I started about two years ago called Home Team Medical Services (or just "Home Team" for short).  I am looking for the ability to take a screen shot of key patient views and copy text so those can be pasted in a location that can be on my local device or on an Azure resource, where we can process the information into a patient explorer app that will enable me to search information I already know about patients and generate custom reports about their overall care plan based on the information we know about them.  This patient explorer app doesn't need to act as a full on EMR, but just a place to collect and organize the information.  Home Team currently uses Athena One as EMR, and we have established connection to their Data View and API capabilities; however, the support from Athena has been so limited and frustrating that we are considering a switch to Open EMR and just manually making our own EMR to save on costs while making it function exactly the way we want.  The Patient Explorer app is just the first phase, and could ideally accommodate information from at least screen shots and copy/paste text from either Allscripts or Athena to generate a HIPAA compliant library for all of my patients in either location.

## Claude Response:

This is an excellent strategic project, and Claude Code can be a powerful tool for building out your Patient Explorer app. Let me break down how to approach this effectively.

## Getting the Most from Claude Code for Your Situation

**Start with clear, scoped tasks.** Given your development experience level, the most effective approach with Claude Code is to break your Patient Explorer into discrete, well-defined pieces rather than asking it to build everything at once. Claude Code excels when you give it specific context about what you're trying to accomplish and what constraints you're working within.

**Leverage your team structure.** Since Pat is well-versed in VS Code and Claude Code, and Pavel handles backend, consider positioning yourself as the requirements and workflow expert. You know exactly how patient information flows, what views matter in Allscripts, and what reports you'll need. That domain knowledge is invaluable—let Claude Code help you translate those requirements into working code while your team reviews the technical implementation.

## Architecture Recommendations for Patient Explorer

For your specific use case, I'd suggest a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Local Capture and Storage**

A simple desktop or web app that lets you paste screenshots and text, tags them with patient identifiers (you'll want to think carefully about how you handle PHI even in transit), and stores them locally or pushes to Azure Blob Storage with encryption at rest. Claude Code can help you scaffold this quickly using Python with a simple GUI (like PyQt or even a local web interface with Flask) or TypeScript with Electron if you prefer a desktop app feel.

**Phase 2: OCR and Text Extraction**

For screenshots, you'll need OCR. Azure has Cognitive Services for this, and since you're already in the Azure ecosystem for HIPAA compliance, that's a natural fit. Claude Code can help you write the integration code to send images to Azure's Computer Vision API and extract structured text.

**Phase 3: Patient Explorer Interface**

A searchable interface that lets you query across all captured information, with the ability to generate care plan summaries. This could be a simple web app—React or even a Python-based dashboard—that queries your stored data.

## Practical Claude Code Tips

When working with Claude Code, provide context files. Before starting, have Claude Code read any existing project structure, your technical constraints (HIPAA compliance, Azure BAA requirements), and examples of the data formats you're working with. You might create a project README that describes your architecture decisions so Claude Code can reference it.

Be explicit about your skill level. Telling Claude Code that you want explanations of why certain approaches are recommended, not just the code, will help you learn while building. You can ask it to comment code thoroughly or explain trade-offs.

Use it iteratively. Start a conversation with something like: "I want to build a patient data capture tool. Let's start with just the ability to paste text and save it to a local SQLite database with basic encryption. Walk me through setting this up step by step."

## Regarding Your EMR Considerations

The frustration with Athena's support is common, and OpenEMR is a legitimate option—but building and maintaining your own EMR is a significant undertaking that goes well beyond what your Patient Explorer needs. I'd suggest keeping those as separate decisions: Patient Explorer is a data aggregation and viewing tool that can sit alongside *any* EMR, while the EMR decision involves regulatory, workflow, and long-term maintenance considerations that deserve their own analysis.

Would you like me to help you draft an initial project specification for the Patient Explorer that you could share with Pat and Pavel, or would you prefer to dive into a specific technical component first—like setting up the basic capture interface or the Azure storage integration?

# RG prompt 2:

Let's get started and go as far as we can to set up the Patient Explorer function.  Shall I copy and paste this chat into VS code window where I am already working with Claude Code?  Is there a better way to catalogue our conversations here and store them to act as a reference knowledge base within a VS code workspace vs. as a project file that doesn't have to be in VS code?

## Claude Response:

Great questions about workflow organization. Here's what works best:

## Don't Copy/Paste Entire Chats

Raw chat logs are noisy and inefficient as context. Instead, use a structured approach that gives Claude Code what it actually needs.

## The CLAUDE.md Convention

Claude Code automatically reads a file called `CLAUDE.md` at the root of your project. This is your primary way to give it persistent context. Create one that contains:

- Project purpose and goals
- Key architecture decisions
- Your role and constraints (HIPAA compliance, Azure ecosystem, etc.)
- Links to more detailed docs if needed

## Recommended Project Structure

For Patient Explorer, I'd suggest setting up something like this:

```
PatientExplorer/
├── CLAUDE.md              # High-level context for Claude Code
├── docs/
│   ├── requirements.md    # What the app needs to do
│   ├── architecture.md    # Technical decisions
│   └── decisions/         # Architecture Decision Records
│       └── 001-storage-approach.md
├── src/                   # Your actual code
└── README.md              # Standard project readme
```

## What to Put Where

**CLAUDE.md** should be concise—think of it as a quick briefing. Key facts about the project, your tech stack, compliance requirements.

**docs/** is where you'd put more detailed reference material, including summaries of important conversations or decisions we make here.

## About Our Conversations Here

I do retain memory of our past discussions, so you don't need to manually archive everything for my benefit in Claude.ai. I already know about your HT_Clinical project, your ChartBuilder work, your Azure/HIPAA setup, and your development background. When you come back to me, I'll have that context.

For Claude Code though, it only knows what's in your project files—so anything critical needs to live in your repo.

Want me to draft an initial CLAUDE.md and requirements.md for Patient Explorer that you can drop into a new project folder? That would give you a solid starting point to hand off to Claude Code.
