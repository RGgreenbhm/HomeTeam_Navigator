# Research Topic

Conduct research on a user-specified topic and generate a comprehensive research report.

## Instructions

When this command is invoked:

### Step 1: Get Topic from User

If no topic is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, ask the user:

```
What topic would you like me to research?

Please provide:
1. **Topic**: The subject to research
2. **Context** (optional): Why you need this research, any specific questions to answer
3. **Scope** (optional): Narrow focus, broad overview, or specific depth areas
```

### Step 2: Conduct Research

Use available tools to research the topic:

1. **Web Search** - Search for current information, documentation, best practices
2. **Codebase Search** - Check if topic relates to existing code/docs in workspace
3. **Documentation Fetch** - Retrieve official documentation if applicable
4. **Cross-Reference** - Validate information across multiple sources

### Step 3: Generate Research Report

Create a comprehensive markdown report with this structure:

```markdown
# Research Report: [Topic Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Researcher:** Claude (AI Assistant)
**Requested By:** [User context if provided]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]

---

## Background

[Context and why this topic matters]

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: [Title]
[Details, evidence, sources]

### Finding 2: [Title]
[Details, evidence, sources]

[Continue as needed...]

---

## Technical Details

[If applicable - code examples, configurations, specifications]

---

## Recommendations

1. **[Recommendation 1]** - [Rationale]
2. **[Recommendation 2]** - [Rationale]
[Continue as needed...]

---

## Risks & Considerations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [Impact] | [Mitigation] |

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] [Actionable item 1]
- [ ] [Actionable item 2]

---

## Sources & References

1. [Source 1](URL) - [Brief description]
2. [Source 2](URL) - [Brief description]

---

*Research conducted: YYYY-MM-DD*
*Generated by Claude via /research-topic command*
```

### Step 4: Generate Filename

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_research_[brief-topic-description].md`

Rules for topic description:
- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Maximum 50 characters
- Remove articles (a, an, the)
- Focus on key nouns/concepts

Examples:
- `2025-12-04_research_oauth-token-refresh-patterns.md`
- `2025-12-04_research_hipaa-compliant-cloud-storage.md`
- `2025-12-04_research_streamlit-authentication-options.md`

### Step 5: Save Research Report

Save the markdown file to: `docs/research/[filename].md`

### Step 6: Generate PDF Version

After saving the markdown file, automatically generate a PDF version:

1. Ensure `Export_Ready/` folder exists
2. Run the PDF export using md-to-pdf:
   ```bash
   npx md-to-pdf "docs/research/[filename].md"
   ```
3. Move the generated PDF to `Export_Ready/`:
   ```bash
   mv "docs/research/[filename].pdf" "Export_Ready/[filename].pdf"
   ```

### Step 7: Report to User

Confirm completion:

```
Research completed!

**Topic:** [Topic title]
**Markdown:** docs/research/[filename].md
**PDF:** Export_Ready/[filename].pdf

## Key Findings Summary
- [Finding 1 - one line]
- [Finding 2 - one line]
- [Finding 3 - one line]

Would you like me to:
1. Dive deeper into any specific finding?
2. Research a related topic?
3. Add this to the session planner for follow-up?
```

## Research Quality Guidelines

- **Cite sources** - Always include URLs/references for claims
- **Be objective** - Present multiple perspectives when relevant
- **Stay current** - Prioritize recent information (2024-2025)
- **Be actionable** - Include practical recommendations
- **Consider context** - Relate findings to the Patient_Explorer project where relevant

## HIPAA Considerations

If researching healthcare-related topics:
- Note compliance implications
- Identify BAA requirements
- Flag any PHI handling concerns
- Reference relevant regulations

## Example Usage

```
/research-topic OAuth 2.0 token refresh best practices for desktop apps
```

Or simply:

```
/research-topic
```
(Will prompt for topic)
